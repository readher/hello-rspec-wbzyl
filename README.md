This repository contains a solution to the exercise „Beer Song” downloaded
from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io):
```sh
exercism fetch ruby beer-song
```


## Integration with Travis

Begin with downloading gems to local folder _vendor/bundle_:
```sh
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

* [How to use Travis CI with GitHub hosted repository](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/).
* [Embedding Status Images](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/) –
  also known as badges or icons that show the status of your build into your README or website.


## Code Coverage with SimpleCov gem

[SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) is a code coverage analysis
tool for Ruby.

Add gem _simplecov_ to [Gemfile](Gemfile).
Next, require and run _Simplecov_ from the top [spec_helper.rb](spec/spec_helper.rb)
file:
```ruby
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start
```
Now, run tests, open up _coverage/index.html_ in your browser and check out
code coverage.


## Integration with Code Climate

[Code Climate](https://docs.codeclimate.com) empowers organizations to take
control of their code quality by incorporating fully configurable test coverage
and maintainability data throughout the development workflow.

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

* Remove as much duplication as you possibly can.
* Optimize for readability, even if it means introducing duplication.
* If you've removed all the duplication, do you have a lot of
  conditionals? Try replacing the conditionals with polymorphism, if it
  applies in this language. How readable is it?

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?

* * * *

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride hello_world_test.rb
